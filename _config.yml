  Hi, my name's Frank, and I'm currently a software engineer intern at Uber AI. I'm also in my 4th year as an undergraduate student at Unvierstiy of Waterloo, studying Computer Science with an AI specialization. 
  I'm very excited about artificial intelligence and computer vision. I'm fascinated with 
  - generative models
  - view synthesis
  - scene understanding
  - autonomous driving
  - semi-supervised learning
  
  My mission is to explore state-of-the-art and apply them to solve downstream challenges.

        #   I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
